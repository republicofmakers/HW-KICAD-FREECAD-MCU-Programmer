This will be MCU Programmer with pogo pins. It is under development.

I design simple pogo pin testers but these are more suitable for low volume production.

This is a tester for high volume production. (upto 128 MCU , depend on the panel size)

This project will provide to :

1. Upload code to PCB
   
2. Test the code / Hardware

3. Report/Record error (if there are any)
   
4. Set Security Bits (Read protection for MCU flash)

This project hopefully will be open source.
